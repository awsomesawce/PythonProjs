This is my first attempt at using __Conda__ as the package _and_ environment manager.

One small problem is that the `conda.exe` executable doesn't have a good way of seeing a
more detailed description of specific packages at the command line.

Tools like `npm` will give nice info about a package if you ask for it.
> `npm` also has the all-powerful _home_/_docs_ command which automatically opens the
> documentation website of the package in question.
> Oh how I wish `pip` had that functionality.
